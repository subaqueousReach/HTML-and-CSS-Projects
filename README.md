# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This is a repository for projects in my HTML and CSS courses

## Introduction
This repository will be used to store the project files for assignments from my HTML and CSS courses. As projects are developed this readme will be updated to reflect the new information.

### 1. HTML Documents Assignment
These are a collection of html files that are linked together to make a website. These were created so that I can learn the fundamentals of HTML and how the different tags can be utilized to make changes to the content in the webpage.
